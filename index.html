<p>The University of Washington CSE department's <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse481k/14sp/">capstone course for resource constrained environments</a> has a number of groups working on projects related to the <a href="http://www.path.org/projects/cold-chain.php">vaccine cold chain</a>.  The LaosTrainingApp is an application that will be used to train health facility workers in Laos how to use an existing, SMS-based, cold chain reporting system.  The training system will ultimately but used for other purposes and as such needs to be easily extendible to other purposes (and potentially languages other than Lao) by non-technical users.</p>

<p>We have been working hard on a new version of the application.  We are hoping to roll out this new version in Laos by May 14 for a second round of feedback and user testing.  We have added quiz functionality, improved our cloud storage solution, and really worked on making a more friendly UI.

<h1>Less Training, More Practice</h1>
<p>Richard provided some feedback from his trip via Skype on 4/24.  One of his favorite responses from a health worker regarding thier current training was: "Less training, more practice!"  This is our newfound inspiration in this project to really improve the training process.</p>
