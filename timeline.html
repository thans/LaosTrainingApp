<p>This week we got some feedback back from our contacts in Laos after we deployed our application.  They were very impressed by the quiz functionality, but also want to restructure the app to separate out the content further.  We are also in the process of getting all of the resources that we have developed for the application translated as we iron out some of the bugs we come across int the application.</p>

<h2>
<a name="our-timeline" class="anchor" href="#our-timeline"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Timeline</h2>


<p>The following is a timeline of where we plan to be for the 10 week period from March 31 to June 10.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Organization and Design, explore android programming and extensibility options</li>
  <li>Define an extensible structure for application data and implement a version that supports videos</li>
  <li>Extend the application to support images and quizzes and improve UI</li>
  <li>USER TESTING - tablets in Laos. Work with UNICEF; improve UI</li>
  <li>Iterate based on feedback</li>
  <li>Explore a cloud based solution to data storage and synchronization</li>
  <li>Translation - get application translated and ensure the app is language independent</li>
  <li>USER TESTING and iterate based on feedback</li>
  <li>Finalize UI and data storage/synchronization methods</li>
  <li>Ship it!  Present our results</li>
  </ol>
<p>This is our general plan - some portions may prove to take more or less time than anticipated.</p>

<h1>Previous project updates: </h1>

<h2>
<a name="current-status-week-8" class="anchor" href="#current-status-week-8"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status (Weeks 8-9)</h2>

<p>We were not able to roll out another version of our app last week.  We ran into some last minute integration problems, we did not have the materials translated that we hope to, and there were some additional changes necessary to make the application more robust. We have been working hard to resolve these issues while simultaneously developing new components for a future release - we are adding custom applications for FridgeTags and SMS messaging.</p>

<h2>
<a name="current-status-week-6" class="anchor" href="#current-status-week-6"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status (6-7)</h2>
<p>We are ready to roll out a second version for testing in Laos!  Quizzes are fully implemented, the UI has been overhauled, and the app tightly integrates with google drive.  We are excited to see what feedback we will get and where we can go from here!

<h2>
<a name="current-status-week-5" class="anchor" href="#current-status-week-5"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status (Weeks 5-6)</h2>

<p>We have been working hard on a new version of the application.  We are hoping to roll out this new version in Laos by May 14 for a second round of feedback and user testing.  We have added quiz functionality, improved our cloud storage solution, and really worked on making a more friendly UI.

<h2>
<a name="current-status-weeks-3-4" class="anchor" href="#current-status-weeks-3-4"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status (Weeks 4-5)</h2>

<p>Richard came back from Laos and we debreifed his trip on 4/29.  It was good to get feedback on how the app will actually be used!  We will now focus on making some changes to our application to address this feedback.  One major change is rather than making the application completely extensible with no built in content, we are probably going to implement some custom applications that will come built in to the training application, one specifically for use with the cold chain.

<h2><a name="midweek-4-27" class="anchor" href="#midweek-4-27"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Midweek Update (4/27)</h2>
<p>Richard provided some feedback from his trip via Skype on 4/24.  One of his favorite responses from a health worker regarding thier current training was: "Less training, more practice!"  This is our newfound inspiration in this project to really improve the training process.</p>

<p>Our app is deployed in Laos!  Richard is using slides we provided to demonstrate a content creation workflow and how to install the application.  He is also setting up our first version of user testing!  We are excited for the feedback.  Right now we are working on improving the UI, the google drive integration, and adding support for quizzes.
</p>

<h2><a name="week-2" class="anchor" href="#week-2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 2</h2>
<p>We are currently implementing v1 of the application.  Our focus is on the extensibility aspect for the moment (see Timeline week 2)</p>
