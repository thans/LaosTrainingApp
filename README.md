LaosTrainingApp
========

The University of Washington CSE department's [capstone course for resource constrained environments](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse481k/14sp/) has a number of groups working on projects related to the [vaccine cold chain](http://www.path.org/projects/cold-chain.php).  The LaosTrainingApp is an application that will be used to train health facility workers in Laos how to use an existing, SMS-based, cold chain reporting system.  The training system will ultimately but used for other purposes and as such needs to be easily extendible to other purposes (and potentially languages other than Lao) by non-technical users.


Current Status - Week 2
========
We are currently implementing v1 of the application.  Our focus is on the extensibility aspect for the moment (see Timeline week 2)

Our Timeline
========
The following is a timeline of where we plan to be for the 10 week period from March 31 to June 10.

1. Organization and Design, explore android programming and extensibility options
2. Define an extensible structure for application data and implement a version that supports videos
3. Extend the application to support images and quizzes and improve UI
4. USER TESTING - tablets in Laos. Work with UNICEF; improve UI
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Explore a cloud based solution to data storage and synchronization
7. Translation - get application translated and ensure the app is language independent
8. USER TESTING and iterate based on feedback
9. Finalize UI and data storage/synchronization methods
10. Ship it!  Present our results

This is our general plan - some portions may prove to take more or less time than anticipated.
